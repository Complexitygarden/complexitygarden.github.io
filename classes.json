Examples include Sorting, Shortest Paths, Primality Testing, Linear Programming, and Finding a maximum matching in a general graph. A decision problem is P-complete if it is in P, and every problem in P can be reduced to it in Logarithmic Space (L). Circuit evaluation is a P complete problem: given a Boolean circuit and an input, decide what the circuit outputs when given the input. P is contained in NP, but whether or not they are equal is an open problem. "
